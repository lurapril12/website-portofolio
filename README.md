<!-- TEA SPILL -->
## üåù Tea Spill

WOW am I in love with React. After learning React, this is one of the funnest projects I've done so far because the components are so organized and my code is so DRY!!! I'm not the biggest fan of Bootstrap, but it made responsiveness pretty quick and simple (I can't wait to tackle Tailwind). Learning about the typing effect for my banner section was so cool - I have the same effect on my github page but I always wanted to look into how it worked and now I've built one myself! This was my first time using animate.css and I used it in a pretty simple way, so I can't wait to see how I can use this tool in the future. Overall, I'm absolutely loving the simplicity of the site.

04/25/2023 Update: Migrated the CRA app to a Vercel deployed Next.js app :~) Set up a new /links route with Next's routing (sooo easy). Migrated the jsx files to tsx files.

06/04/2023 Update: [Someone](https://github.com/foxkdev) actually completely stole all of my GitHub README and entire portfolio repo, and the scandal got a lot of attention on LinkedIn. After that, I had many developers ask to use my portfolio as a template so I created a new [portfolio](https://alexisin.tech) (more of my style anyways) for my use and gave this template to the community!
